# Workflow: Context Handover & Export
# Trigger: /handover [goal]

This workflow compiles the Agent's "Long Term Memory" into a single, portable prompt that can be pasted into a new AI session or given to a human developer.

## 1. Gather Intelligence
- [ ] Read `.agent/memory/project-summary.md` (The PRD).
- [ ] Read `.agent/memory/structure.md` (The Map).
- [ ] Read `.agent/rules/tech-stack.md` (The Constraints).
- [ ] Read `.agent/memory/scratchpad.md` (Current Status).

## 2. Generate the "Golden Prompt"
Create a single Code Block containing the text below. Fill in the {{handlebars}} with the content read in Step 1.

    ```markdown
    # HANDOVER PROMPT: SYSTEM TRANSFER

    You are an expert software engineer taking over an active project.
    
    ## 1. The Mission
    **Goal**: {{Input the user's goal from the /handover command}}
    **Vision**: {{Content from project-summary.md -> Vision}}

    ## 2. The Architecture
    **Tech Stack**:
    {{Content from rules/tech-stack.md}}

    **File Structure**:
    {{Content from memory/structure.md}}

    ## 3. Current Context
    **Active Tasks**:
    {{Content from memory/scratchpad.md}}

    **Key Decisions/Constraints**:
    - Consult `.agent/rules/` for strict coding standards.
    - Consult `.agent/memory/lessons.md` for known pitfalls.

    ## INSTRUCTIONS
    1. Digest this context.
    2. Acknowledge the architecture constraints.
    3. Begin working on the **Goal** immediately.
    ```

## 3. Final Step
- Present the code block to the user.
- instruction: "Copy the block above and paste it into your new chat session."
