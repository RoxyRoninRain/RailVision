# Code Quality Standards

## Readability & Style
- **Comments**: Comments must explain *WHY* logic exists, not *WHAT* it does.
    - *Bad*: `i += 1 # increment i`
    - *Good*: `i += 1 # offset index to skip the header row`
- **Naming**: Variables must be descriptive. `user_data` is better than `obj`.
- **Function Length**: If a function exceeds [50] lines, refactor it into smaller helper functions.

## Error Handling
- **No Silent Failures**: Never use empty `try/catch` blocks. Log the error or re-raise it.
- **User Feedback**: Errors expected to be seen by users must be descriptive (not "Error 500").

## Testing Requirements
- **Golden Rule**: Logic is not "Done" until it has a test.
- **Mocking**: Mock external API calls; do not hit real servers during tests.
