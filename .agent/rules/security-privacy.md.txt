# Security & Privacy Protocols

## Data Safety
- **Secrets**: NEVER hardcode API keys, passwords, or tokens. Use `.env` files.
- **Logging**: Never log Personally Identifiable Information (PII) like emails or phone numbers.
- **Git**: Ensure `.gitignore` includes `.env`, `__pycache__`, and `node_modules`.

## Input Validation
- **SQL Injection**: Always use parameterized queries or ORM methods. Never concatenate strings into SQL.
- **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)**: Escape all user input before rendering it to the DOM.

## Agent Behavior Rule
- **Audit**: Before marking a task as "Complete," scan the changed files for hardcoded strings that look like keys (e.g., `sk-proj-...`).
